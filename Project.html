                    <p>An <span class="highlight">Automated Irrigation System using Raspberry Pi</span> is a smart farming solution designed to optimize water usage and improve crop health. This system utilizes <span class="highlight">Raspberry Pi</span> as the central controller, which gathers real-time data from <span class="highlight">soil moisture sensors, temperature sensors, and humidity sensors</span>. Based on predefined moisture thresholds, the Raspberry Pi automatically <span class="highlight">activates or deactivates water pumps or solenoid valves</span>, ensuring plants receive the required amount of water. Additionally, the system can be integrated with <span class="highlight">IoT and cloud services</span> to enable remote monitoring and control via a mobile app or web interface. By reducing manual intervention, preventing water wastage, and enhancing efficiency, this automated irrigation system is a cost-effective and eco-friendly solution for modern agriculture.</p>
